### Features/What I learned
The app is an application of Clarifai AI face detection model. With any given image url, the app is able to detect the location of human faces in the image. The app also has user authentication and authorization to secure the API. Only logged-in users are able to use app. Unlike previous React app I built, I used component style to code this React app to compare and contrast with functional style. I believe it is important to be well versed in both styles as there are still lots of apps written in the component style. To expand with more features, I could move the app to Docker and use Auth0 or Passport to handle authentication and authorization. I also think the app could allow users to upload multiple images at once to increase productivity. Overall, I learned a lot from this project.
